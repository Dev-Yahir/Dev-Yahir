## Hello, My name is Yahir Mota and this is a little bit of information about me
I am a senior at the University of California, Merced and I will be a part of the graduating cohort of Fall 2025. I love physical activities such as working out and I also enjoy taking meaningful amounts of time looking at the dawn/dusk sky.
